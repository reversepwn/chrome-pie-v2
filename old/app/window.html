            <p>To check if your jailbroken click the "search" key on your chromebook
                (the magnifying glass) then search for "pie" and if you see an app
                called "Chrome Pie" then you should be good to go.</p>

                You
                need to have the pico (or your prefered device, with pie installed and
                compiled success fully on it) to enable any tweaks (for now)</h4>
            <h2 id="using-pie-to-enable-linux">Using pie to enable linux</h2>
            <p>Launch <strong>Chrome Pie</strong> and under <strong>tools</strong>
                there should be an option to enable linux. Press that and then press
                <strong>apply</strong> and your device should restart.
            </p>
            <p>To see if it worked go into settings &gt; advanced &gt; developers
                &gt; "Linux development environment". This button that was gray before
                should be blue. Then just click <strong>Turn on</strong> and follow the
                steps.</p>

            <p>*My button is grayed out beacuse my device isnt jailbroken (yet)

                know if my device got reseted (un jailbroken)?</h2>
            <p>Sadly your device has a chance of getting unjailbroken but to check
                if you are unjailbroken just click the "search" key on your chromebook
                (the magnifying glass) then search for "pie" and if you see an app
                called "Chrome Pie" then you should still be jailbroken.</p>
            <p>If its not there then sadly you are jailbroken, just rejailbreak and
                your good, all of your old settings should be there.</p>
            <h3 id="you-might-have-the-app-but-you-are-still-unjailbroken">You might
                have the app but you are still unjailbroken</h3>
            <p>To check if you are still jailbroken go into the app and under
                <strong>debug</strong> press the <strong>check jailbreak status</strong>
                if you are still jailbroken you will get an return saying "<strong>Your
                    device is still jailbroken</strong>" if its unjailbroken then it will
                say "<strong>Your device got reseted, please rejailbreak
                    it</strong>"
            </p>

                You

                success fully on it) to rejailbreak. The app cant make any changes to
                the file system and other data (for now, working on an bypass)</h3>
